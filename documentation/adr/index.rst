Architecture Design Records
===========================

During the development of samconf, decisions have to be made. This chapter
provides a place to collect new ideas and discuss them until we are able to
agree on a final decision for a topic.


An *Architecture Design Record* (**ADR**) should follow roughly the pattern

* Problem Description
* Influencing factors
* Assumptions
* Considered Alternatives
* Decision
  * Rational
  * Open Points

There is an ADR-Template :doc:`ADR_template` which can be started with.
